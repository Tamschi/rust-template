## Pull Requests

This repository uses fairly extensive CI to make sure everything is in order.  
Travis CI will automatically build and test your pull requests.

**I recommend working on branches with a `-` in their name.**  
The CI is configured slightly differently for them to make WIP code a bit easier.

Additionally, when you run `cargo test` for the first time, [cargo-husky] sets up a Git pre-push hook to run tests.  
This includes a branch name check, which is ignored on any branches that have a `-` in their name.  
You can still push failing builds using `git push --no-verify`.

Warnings are only denied on `develop`, but the CI should still detect them for pull requests towards that branch.

Please add yourself to each copyright holders list of [LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) and [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) when contributing.
